# Micro Frontends

Micro frontends represent an architectural style where a web application's user interface is broken down into smaller, self-contained modules, each representing a specific feature or functionality. These independent modules, referred to as "micro frontends," can be developed, tested, and deployed autonomously by separate teams. This approach mirrors the principles of microservices but applied to the frontend, transforming monolithic frontend applications into a collection of smaller, more manageable units.

## The Problem Micro Frontends Solve

Traditional monolithic frontend architectures can pose several challenges, especially as applications grow:

- **Difficult Onboarding:** New developers struggle with large codebases.
- **Slowed Development Process:** Multiple teams working on the same codebase can lead to bottlenecks.
- **Deployment Complexity:** Even small changes may require redeploying the entire app.
- **Code Conflicts:** Shared codebases increase the risk of merge conflicts.
- **Team Coordination Overhead:** More developers = more alignment issues.

## Benefits of Micro Frontends

- **Independent Development:** Teams can work autonomously, reducing dependencies.
- **Module Autonomy:** Updates or bugs in one module don‚Äôt affect the whole app.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Each team can use the best tech stack for their module.
- **Improved Scalability:** Scale only the parts of the app that need it.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** Easier to test, update, and maintain smaller modules.

## How Micro Frontends Work

Micro frontends are integrated into a unified app using one of several strategies:

### üîπ Client-side Integration (Runtime)
- Uses tools like **Webpack Module Federation**.
- Micro frontends are loaded dynamically in the browser.
- ‚úÖ Flexibility  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex communication/state handling

### üîπ Server-side Composition
- Micro frontends are combined on the server before rendering.
- ‚úÖ Better SEO, faster initial load  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires full-stack expertise

### üîπ Build-Time Integration
- Modules are bundled together during the build step.
- ‚úÖ Fewer requests, better performance  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower builds, tighter coupling

### üîπ Routing-Based Approach
- Each micro frontend is linked to a specific route (URL).
- ‚úÖ Good for large apps  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shared routing complexity

### üîπ Composition-Based Approach
- A central **shell** app controls rendering and communication.
- ‚úÖ UI consistency  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration challenges

### üîπ Iframe-Based Approach
- Each micro frontend is rendered in an iframe.
- ‚úÖ Strong isolation  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Styling and communication can be difficult

### Web Components
- Each module is a **custom element** with Shadow DOM.
- ‚úÖ Framework-agnostic, style isolated  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited browser support/features depending on use

## Key Concepts and Principles

- **Independent Development:** Build, test, and deploy separately
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Use different stacks across modules
- **Composition:** Combine micro frontends at runtime or build time
- **Communication:** Use events, shared stores, or APIs
- **Autonomous Teams:** Teams own specific domains/modules
- **Resilient Design:** Failures in one module don‚Äôt break the whole app
- **Scalability:** Scale specific modules independently

---

## Summary

Micro frontends are a powerful solution for building **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **modular** frontend architectures. They empower teams to deliver features independently, encourage innovation by supporting different tech stacks, and help avoid common monolithic pitfalls.

However, they also introduce complexity in setup, integration, and communication, so proper planning and architecture decisions are crucial for success.
