**What is HTML5?**

**HTML5** is the latest major version of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**, which is the standard markup language used to structure content on the web. It was officially finalized in October 2014 and has revolutionized web development by introducing a wide range of new features and capabilities to create dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly web pages and applications.

**Problems Solved by HTML5:**

HTML5 addressed several shortcomings of earlier HTML versions, leading to advancements in web development.

*   **Improved Multimedia Handling:** HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video with the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
*   **Enhanced Semantic Structure:** Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` were added to provide clearer meaning to web content, improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
*   **More Advanced Form Functionality:** New form controls and input types were introduced, simplifying the implementation of features like date and color pickers.
*   **Better Client-Side Data Storage:** HTML5's Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) offered increased capacity and improved performance compared to cookies for storing data locally in the browser.
*   **Simplified Dynamic Graphics and Animations:** The `<canvas>` element and Canvas API allowed for the creation of dynamic graphics and animations directly within the browser using JavaScript.
*   **More Consistent Error Handling:** HTML5 provided clearer rules for parsing and handling invalid HTML, leading to more consistent browser behavior.
*   **Improved Mobile and Cross-Device Compatibility:** Features like viewport meta tags and touch event support were included to enhance the creation of responsive and touch-friendly websites for mobile devices.

**How HTML5 Works:**

HTML5 functions as a markup language interpreted by web browsers.

1.  **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration indicates to the browser that the document is HTML5.
2.  **Elements and Tags:** HTML5 uses elements and tags to structure content. Elements include start tags, content, and end tags, while tags define the purpose of content.
3.  **Semantic Elements:** Semantic elements provide meaning and structure to content, aiding search engines and assistive technologies.
4.  **Attributes:** Attributes provide additional information and modify element behavior.
5.  **Browser Interpretation and DOM:** Browsers read HTML5 code, creating a Document Object Model (DOM) representation of the page.
6.  **Rendering:** Browsers, along with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, render the visual web page.
7.  **APIs:** HTML5 includes APIs for extending functionality, enabling features like geolocation and local storage.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **HTML:** Standard markup language for web pages.
*   **HTML5:** Latest major version of HTML with new features.
*   **Semantic Elements:** Tags conveying the meaning of content.
*   **DOCTYPE Declaration:** Indicates the HTML version to the browser.
