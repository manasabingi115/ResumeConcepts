**What are React Hooks?**

**React Hooks** are special functions introduced in **React 16.8** that allow you to use **state** and other **React features** within **functional components**. Before Hooks, these features were only available in class components. Hooks essentially let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components, making them more powerful and versatile.

**Problems Solved by React Hooks:**

React Hooks were introduced to address several challenges in traditional React development, especially when working with class components:

*   **Difficulty in Reusing Stateful Logic:** Sharing stateful logic between class components often involved complex patterns like **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** or **render props**, leading to "wrapper hell". Hooks provide a more direct way to extract and reuse stateful logic by creating **custom hooks**, without changing the component hierarchy.
*   **Complex Components Becoming Hard to Understand:**  Class components could become large and difficult to manage with logic spread across lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`). Hooks allow you to split one component into smaller functions based on related logic, improving code organization and readability.
*   **Confusion with `this` Keyword:** Managing the `this` keyword in class components could be confusing. Hooks eliminate the need for `this`, leading to cleaner code.
*   **Limited Capabilities of Functional Components:**  Before Hooks, functional components were primarily stateless. Hooks empower them to manage state and side effects, making them as powerful as class components.
*   **Boilerplate Code in Class Components:**  Class components often required more boilerplate code for state initialization and method binding. Hooks offer a more concise approach.

**How React Hooks Work (In-depth):**

Hooks are JavaScript functions used within functional components to access React features.

1.  **Built-in Hooks:** React provides various built-in Hooks:
    *   **`useState`:** Adds local state to functional components, returning the state value and an update function.
    *   **`useEffect`:** Handles side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation. Replaces class lifecycle methods. Can return a cleanup function.
    *   **`useContext`:** Allows components to consume context values, avoiding prop drilling.
    *   **`useReducer`:** Manages complex state logic using a reducer function.
    *   **`useCallback` and `useMemo`:** Performance hooks for memoizing functions and values.
    *   **`useRef`:** Persists mutable values across renders, often for DOM interaction.
2.  **Rules of Hooks:**  Important rules include calling Hooks only at the top level and only from React functions (functional components or custom hooks).
3.  **Custom Hooks:**  You can create custom hooks (JavaScript functions starting with `use`) to reuse stateful logic.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **State:** Data internal to a component that can change over time.
*   **Side Effects:** Operations that interact with the outside world, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation.
*   **Context:** A mechanism for sharing data across the component tree without prop drilling.
*   **Functional Components:**  React components defined as JavaScript functions.
*   **Class Components:**  React components defined as ES6 classes.
*   **Prop Drilling:**  Passing props down through multiple levels of the component tree.
*   **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):**  A pattern for sharing logic by wrapping components, {Link: now often replaced by Hooks for better readability and reusability https://www.getfishtank.com/insights/understanding-react-hooks}.

Hooks have significantly improved React development by making functional components more capable, code more reusable, and enhancing efficiency. They are now the recommended approach for new React components.
