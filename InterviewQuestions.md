### React & Routing Interview Topics

- How can we interrupt an API call while it's happening?
- `display: block` vs `display: inline`
- How to protect routing in React (e.g., authentication guards)
- Nested routing in React
- Is there any built-in routing in React?
- How to pass arguments to a router (e.g., route parameters, query params)
- Write a function to flatten a nested array. Using the Array.prototype.flat() method is not always a good practice. Explain why this approach may not be ideal in certain cases, and provide a better (recursive) approach to fully flatten an array of any depth.
- Conditions of hooks
